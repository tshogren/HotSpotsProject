# HotSpotsProject
The goal of this app is to inform underclassmen and prospective students about Macalester's campus. The home screen 
shows a map of the important spots on campus. Each spot has a description of what the spot is, and tags that
tell you what students do at these spots. There is a suggestion box where users can suggest their favorite spots to be 
put on the map. Other user's suggestions will go directly on the map, but there is the option to remove them. You can 
like or dislike these spots.
