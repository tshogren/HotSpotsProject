  <b>How to use the app:</b>
<hr>
  HotSpots is an app that shows all of the important buildings and spots on Macalester's campus.
  Each of the different icons corresponds to a different kind of building/spot. If you tap one of the
  icons, information about that spot will show up, telling you its name, its intended purpose and what students
  actually use it for. There is a filter icon in the upper right corner. You can use this to choose which type
  of buildings you want to see on the map by checking the boxes. In the lower right corner, there is a button that
  centers the map to Macalester's campus.
